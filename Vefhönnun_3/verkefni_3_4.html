        <p>I only want to do what I really want to do; otherwise, 
            I'm content to sit here and play my guitar all day.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'd like to produce, direct, write, score, and star 
            in a film in exactly the way Chaplin did. I'll do that before I'm thirty.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've always had confidence. It came because I have lots of initiative. 
            I wanted to make something of myself.

            That's my idol, Elvis Presley. If you went to my 
            house, you`d see pictures all over of Elvis. He's just 
            the greatest entertainer that ever lived. And I think it's 
            because he had such presence. When Elvis walked into a room, 
            Elvis Presley was in the fucking room. I don't give a fuck 
            who was in the room with him, Bogart, Marilyn Monroe.

            Alright, listen up! I don't like white people. I hate rednecks. 
            You people are rednecks. That means I'm enjoyin' this shit.
            <br>

            Now, a brother's dick is too big, so it'll fuck up his balance... Every time you 
            see a brother in a wheelchair, he ain't always crippled.
