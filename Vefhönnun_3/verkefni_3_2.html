        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Mr. Potato Head's 
            popularity has led to some appearances in films 
            and television. In 1985, Mr. Potato Head played 
            a supporting role in Potato Head Kids, his first 
            dramatic television appearance. In 1998–1999, 
            he had his own short-lived Fox Kids series, The 
            Mr. Potato Head Show. In addition to film and 
            television, the character has been the subject 
            of a comic strip created by Jim Davis. Cartoonist 
            Gary Larson included the character in several 
            of his The Far Side cartoons. In commercial for 
            Bridgestone tires during Super Bowl XLIII in 
            2009, Mr. Potato Head is driving a car and 
            Mrs. Potato Head is nagging him.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Oh wow!</h1>
        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">On April 30, 1952, 
            Mr. Potato Head became the first toy advertised 
            on television. The campaign was also the first 
            to be aimed directly at children; before this, 
            commercials were only targeted at adults, 
            so toy adverts had always been pitched to 
            parents. This commercial revolutionized 
            marketing, and caused an industrial boom. 
            Over one million kits were sold in the first 
            year. In 1953, Mrs. Potato Head was added, 
            and soon after, Brother Spud and Sister Yam 
            completed the Potato Head family with accessories 
            reflecting the affluence of the 1950s that included 
            a car, a boat trailer, a kitchen set, a stroller, 
            and pets called Spud-ettes. Although originally 
            produced as separate plastic parts to be stuck into 
            a real potato or other vegetable, a plastic potato 
            was added to the kit in 1964.</p>

            In 1952, George Lerner of New York City invented 
            and patented Mr. Potato Head based on an earlier 
            toy called "make a face" that used a real potato. 
            Lerner originally designed his all-plastic toy as
            a prize for cereal premiums. Mr. Potato Head was 
            the first toy to be advertised on network television.
